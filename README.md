# Compilador
Compilador is a mini compiler that can detect errors in manipulations, done by users on monitoring systems industrial. The system must analyze the trace of tasks a posteriori performed on the HMI to generate an audit report, the output of the compiler will be a finite state machine where the states represent the components of the manipulated HMI and the transitions represent the actions that the user has performed on these component
